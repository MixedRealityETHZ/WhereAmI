# Where Am I? AR Application

This repository contains the AR application of the Where Am I? project for the Mixed Reality course at ETH. The project follows a commonly used unity project structure, but we provide a brief summary nonetheless.

We only mention the files created by us - rest is generated by the unity project automatically, and there is nothing to describe.

* `Assets` - all assets for the unity project, including scenes, materials, models and more
    * `Assets/Materials` - VFX shaders, responsible for the pulsing points, trajectory footsteps animations, map reveal and more
    * `Assets/Models` - 3D models used in the app. Includes the HG overlay, markers placed on the map and some utility models
    * `Assets/Prefabs` - Unity prefabs, = objects that can be added into the world with scripts and components added and with some preset properties
    * `Assets/Rendering` - The render texture for the minimap in the top left corner (only in the Windows demo)
    * `Assets/Scenes` - the scenes of our app. `FirstScene.unity` is the main one used in the app, `DebugScene.unity` has limited functionality, e.g. no networking and some missing features
    * `Assets/Scripts` - All C# scripts used in the app
    * `Assets/Sprites` - Textures used. Includes the footprint, map textures, the HG floor plan, and more
    * Remaining folders were autogenerated by unity or the added packages
* `Utils` - code we used for the preprocessing of the LaMAR dataset
    * `Utils/LamarPointcloudsDownscaling` - reading the PLY file format and selecting a uniformly sampled subset of the points
    * `Utils/LamarReadTrajectories` - parsing the trajectory files of LaMAR, converting them into a format ready to use in unity
    * `Utils/NavigationGraph` - reading LaMAR trajectory files, converting them into a navigation graph that can be used in the app
* Remaining code is generated automatically, we used the procedures shown in the tutorials to create an initial AR project and to obtain all required packages
